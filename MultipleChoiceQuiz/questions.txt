constructor functions		
private members
public members		
If a member variable is declared ________, all objects of that class have access to that variable.
default					
dynamic

A ________ of a base class expects to be overridden in a derived class.
constructor function			
destructor function			
virtual function
static function	
Assume that Car is a class name, and that the Car class has a member function named accelerate. A variable Car *myCar is defined.  Which of the following is a valid call to the accelerate member function?
myCar.accelerate( ); 			
myCar::accelerate( );
myCar:accelerate( ); 			
myCar->accelerate( );
This is a special function that is called whenever a new object is created and initialized with another object's data.
static function				
copy constructor				
destructor 
assignment function			
This type of member variable may be accessed before any objects of the class have been created.
inline					
static					
public
private	
In the following statement class Car: protected Vehicle which is the derived class?
Vehicle					
Car						
protected
None of these
If you do not declare an access specification, the default for members of a class is:
private					
inline					
global
public	
In an inheritance situation, the new class that you create from an existing class is known as the ________.
child class				
inheritee					
derived class

When the body of a member function is defined inside a class declaration, it is said to be:
globally

Appending a node means adding it to the end of a list. ________ a node means putting a new node in the list, but not necessarily at the end.
Inserting				
Clamping				
Popping
Concatenating				
ADT stands for:
Algorithm Driven Template				
Automatic Data Type
Algorithm Dependent Template			
Abstract Data Type
While traversing a list, a node pointer knows when it has reached the end of a list when:
it finds itself back at the beginning of the list
it encounters a sentinel, usually 9999
it encounters the newline character
it encounters NULL
If the head pointer points to NULL, this indicates:
there are no nodes in the list
the list has been previously created and then destroyed
the list needs to be destroyed
the list is full and cannot accept any new nodes
To append a node to a list means to ________.
add a node to the end of the list
delete a node from the beginning of the list
delete a node from the end of the list
add a node to the beginning of the list
A linked list class must take care of removing the dynamically allocated nodes. This is done by ________.
the constructor function
overloading the memory persistence operator
the destructor function
overriding the removal function
